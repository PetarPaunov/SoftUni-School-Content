This **random sentences generator** is just for **fun**! These **sentences** can provide **humor** and be a **cool** way to **surprise** others by sharing a stand-out sentence on **social media** platforms and **gathering** your networkâ€™s reaction.

## How It Works

The **Generator** is based on the following **model**:

- [Sentence] = `Who` + `Action` + `Details`.

  - **Who** = `Name` | `Name` from `Place`
    - Names = {Peter, Michell, Jane, Steve, ...}
    - Places = {Sofia, London, New York, Germany, ...}
    
  - **Action** = `Verb` + `Noun` | `Adverbs` + `Verb` + `Noun`
    - Verbs = {eats, holds, sees, plays with, brings, ...}
    - Nouns = {stones, cakes, apples, laptops, bikes, ...}
    - Adverbs = {slowly, diligently, warmly, sadly, rapidly}
    
  - **Details** = {near the river, at home, in the park}
