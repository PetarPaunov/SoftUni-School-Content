**Guess A Number** is a simple guessing game where a **user** is supposed to **guess** the number that your **oponent** (the computer) has come up with. The program **randomly** selects a number between **1 and 100**. It will then ask the player to **enter their guess**.Each time you enter a number, **the computer will** tell you whether it is **lower** or **higher** than the **expected** number.

You **win** the game when your **number** matches your **computer** number

## Input and Output

Choose **number** between `1` and `100`, then press `Enter`.

The computer selects a **random number**, then returns information whether the number is **less than**, **greater than**, or **equal** to the selected **number**.
