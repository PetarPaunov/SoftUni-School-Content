[Game Of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)) is a simple **card game**, typically played by **two players** using a **standard playing card deck**. There are many **variations**.

Rules:
- Each of the **two players** is **dealt one half** of a **shuffled deck of cards**.
- Each turn, each **player draws one card** from their deck.               
- The player that **drew the card with higher value** gets **both** cards.      
- **Both cards** return to the **winner's deck** and the deck **gets reshuffled**.         
- If there is a **draw**, the **cards are thrown away**.                        
- The player that **runs out of cards first, wins**.  

# Input and Output
- Press `Enter` each time to draw a new card until the game ends.  

The computer will **compare** the cards and **tell you which one has the higher value**.
