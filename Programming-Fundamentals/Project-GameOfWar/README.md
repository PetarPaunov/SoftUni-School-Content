[Game Of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)) is a simple **card game**, typically played by **two players** using a **standard playing card deck**. There are many **variations**.

Rules:
- Each of the **two players** is **dealt one half** of a **shuffled deck of cards**.
- Each turn, each **player draws one card** from their deck.               
- The player that **drew the card with higher value** gets **both** cards.      
  - **Both cards** return to the **winner's deck**.         
- If there is a **draw**, both players place the **next three cards face down** and then **another card face-up**. The owner of the **higher face-up** card **gets all the cards** on the table. 
- The player who **collects all the cards wins**.  

# Input and Output
- Press `Enter` each time to draw a new card until the game ends.  

The computer will **compare** the cards and **tell you which one has the higher value**.
