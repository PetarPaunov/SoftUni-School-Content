[Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) is an **old school favorite**, a **word game** where the goal is simply to find the **missing word**. Originally a [Paper-and-pencil game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper-and-pencil_game). You will be presented with a number of **blank spaces** representing the **missing letters** you need to find. Use the **keyboard** to guess a letter.

- If your **chosen letter** exists in the answer, then **all places** in the answer where that **letter appear will be revealed**.
- Be warned, every time you **guess a letter wrong** you loose a life and the **hangman begins to appear**, piece by piece.
- **Solve** the puzzle **before the hangman dies**.

# Input and Output
- Type a letter between `a` and `z` **inclusive**.
- Press `enter`.

The computer will **check** whether the **letter** is **contained** in the **current word** or **not**.
